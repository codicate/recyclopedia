Cell division in streptococci occurs along a single axis, so as they grow, they tend to form pairs or chains that may appear bent or twisted. This differs from staphylococci, which divide along multiple axes, thereby generating irregular, grape-like clusters of cells. Most streptococci are oxidase-negative and catalase-negative, and many are facultative anaerobes (capable of growth both aerobically and anaerobically).\n\n\nThe term was coined in 1877 by Viennese surgeon **Albert Theodor Billroth** (1829-1894), by combining the prefix “strepto-”, together with the suffix “-coccus”\n\n\nOkay so other than **potentially minor** inconsistencies between the Rich Text Editor state and this… We should hopefully be in pretty good shape regarding the “shape of articles”\n\n\nI’m so grateful, that writing articles isn’t actually our job, cause holy shit there’s a lot of stuff to type and write.
